RM Objects:
	Removal:
		Notify all appropriate shaders

	Draw Order:
		Draw order is shader dependent.
		Notify appropriate shader

	Alterations:
		Have a look at

	Transformations:
		Scaling should be done as an alteration
			Uniform and non-uniform option
			Should be relative to it's parents


RayMarcher:
	Display all shaders:
		Make sure window is stable
		Hide all shader components attached to the game object
		Allow window to open all shaders available, from top toolbar

	Shader Removal:
		Notify all appropriate rm objects


Shader Builder:
	Allow a selection of shaders to build
	Allow for all shaders to be built
	Allow for the creation of Marching Cube compute shaders


Ray March Shader:
	Change to an abstract class, to allow specific types of shaders to be made.
		Rendering
		Marching Cube


Marching Cube:
	Implement own version of algorithm
	Allow 3D volume to be any position in the scene
